To separate state/mode from view,


existing solution was ==> MVC pattern



M1        V1
M2        V2
M3  /     V3
    \      
M4        V4



 MVC always do data-binding in 2-way directions

   => defficult to debug & predict data-flow between UI components ( vews )


   soln:

        => uni-directional data-flow : flux pattern
